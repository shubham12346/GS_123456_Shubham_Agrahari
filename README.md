## **Overview**

This project is a **React** application built with **TypeScript** and **Vite**. It is deployed on **Netlify**, ensuring that every commit to the `master` branch automatically triggers a deployment of the latest code.

Additionally, an **Excel file** is stored in the `public` folder, and all data is fetched from this public asset.

### **Implemented Pages**

The application includes the following pages:

- **DataStore**
- **Skus**
- **Planning**

## **Run Locally**

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (Recommended: v16 or later)
- **Git**
- **Netlify CLI** (if deploying locally)

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/` (or another available port).

## **Fetching Data from Public Assets (Excel File)**

- The **Excel file** is stored in the `public` folder (e.g., `public/data.xlsx`).
- It is accessed using the browserâ€™s `fetch` API or a library like `xlsx`.
- The Excel file is **not bundled** in the build but remains accessible as a public asset.

## **Deployment Process**

- The project is connected to **Netlify** for automatic deployments.
- **Every push to the `master` branch** triggers a deployment.
- Netlify automatically builds the project and deploys the latest version.

### **Manual Deployment (Optional)**

If needed, you can manually deploy using Netlify CLI:

```sh
netlify deploy --prod
```
